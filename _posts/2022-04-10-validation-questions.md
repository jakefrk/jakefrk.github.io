Early on in my job (well, more like for the first year), I was so clueless about what the people around me worked on, or how I could even begin contributing value. I learned the power of asking a question was the way to dig myself out of this hole.


What would it be like if this needed product to be launched this week? What needs to be done to get this moving?”

How will we validate that this new thing is working correctly?

Can we safely test this new thing in an isolated environment, before implementing in production, in order to minimize risks?

What might possibly break if we don’t set this up correctly?

Can you help me better understand what I’m looking at ?

I’d notice my senior colleagues handled every client-facing meeting with confidence and assurance. They would always drive conversations with clients forward, and conclude with next action steps for all parties. However, several times after a meeting or call, a seasoned colleague would turn to me with “Man! I had no idea what that client was talking about! How’d I do?” That was when I realized their skill was not in being a domain or product expert, but by being an expert in voicing the right questions. Solutions Engineers work “in the gray” where things are unclear, and rarely is there a single out-of-the-box solution.

I learned, as my colleagues did, to “throw their answer back” at the customer- by probing, or even challenging, their initial responses. For example, “On our last call, you mentioned you use [method] in order to get [this] to work. Can you help me understand why do you do things this way?”, or “You mentioned this feature of ours you’re considering to accomplish this goal. How do you imagine this working with your system?” During this second round of questions, the customer’s initial answers would unravel, and they may admit ignorance about how they think a feature works, or acknowledge their request is inefficient or overly-complicated, or just not possible- something their sales team just sold. And that’s actually all great, because now we’re all on the same page and can more forward to explore solutions or workarounds. Even though I was not an expert, this approach made me appear as if knew the topic inside and out, and what I didn’t know, I came off as confident that I’m in the progress of understanding the topic during this conversation.
