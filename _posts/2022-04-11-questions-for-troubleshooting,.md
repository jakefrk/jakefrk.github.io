TROUBLESHOOTING QUESTIONS

• During this time frame when we the problem arose, did anything on your end change?

• Have you previously worked on this issue with someone from out company before? Is there an existing email thread or support ticket you can provide to speed along to ensure we’re not repeating previous steps?

• Does the the data show this issue happening suddenly, like numbers dropping off a cliff overnight, or is this over the course of multiple days ?

• In order to ensure you and I are both looking at the same data set from the same source, can you provide the original source (e.g. report, screenshot, file, logs)?

• Can this data be adjusted to give us a clearer picture? For example, can it be broadened (e.g. encompass a longer range of dates). Or, be more granular, and have it broken out by additional dimensions.

• Has the data in this report been manually manipulated, filtered, or “cleaned up” in any way ? Might it make sense to get the raw data ?

• Are there any other people at your company, who are not presently on this call, who may have the information we’re trying to find out here? Can we loop them in?

• Are you able to share your internal documentation with our team so we can review it in depth?


So the “pipes are running” from one product or service to another and the data is flowing, but something somewhere in this system (which you have limited visibility into) has apparently broke, or doesn’t look right, according the client. You have no idea how to troubleshoot because a) you’re still likely new and don’t really understand the issue and b) you’re not the one who “built the pipes”. Perhaps this system has been running for years and the people who set it up are long gone. Maybe the issue is on your end, maybe it’s on the client’s, maybe it’s on a 3rd party, or maybe even further upstream partners. For me, at the beginning, I’d have a knee- jerk reaction whenever the client emailed me saying something is broke- “Crap! I better fix this, whatever it is that’s broken, ASAP.” But that’s not the productive approach. Slow down. Has the client irrefutably proven something is not working? The burden is on them, initially. In many cases, it was more of something just “looking funny” and needed explaining (e.g. a new product release changes the naming conventions of a dimension in analytics).
