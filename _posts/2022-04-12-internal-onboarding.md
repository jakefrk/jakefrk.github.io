A perplexed student (a new hire) sits before a teacher (senior colleague) who has just finished explaining a complicated topic who then asks his student “Any questions?” The problem is, as a new employee new to the industry, you will lack a basic foundation on which to reference 95% of the things that your colleague tried to educate you on during this onboarding session. 

I didn’t know what I didn’t know. In my mind, I wanted to just say “I didn’t understand any of that. Can we go through it again…later?”. You can imagine how thrilled the other person might be to hear that. Alternatively, I’ve come up with the questions and statements that move the dialogue forward without making the teacher feel like a parrot.

Be honest with yourself when you don’t know something, and be genuine and humble to others. If someone more experienced than you asks you “How much of all that did you understand?”, it’s tempting to reply with an inflated figure “A pretty good amount…maybe 40%”, but in reality, it’s closer to 5%. It takes courage to stand in front of an audience and say “I don’t know how to do this. Please help.”
